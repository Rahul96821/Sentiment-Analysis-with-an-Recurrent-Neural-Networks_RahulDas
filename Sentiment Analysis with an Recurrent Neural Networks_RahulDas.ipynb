The textual reviews are preprocessed — including converting to lowercase, removing special characters, and tokenizing the text. The cleaned text data is then transformed into numerical sequences and used to train a Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) model using TensorFlow and Keras.\n","\n","The model learns patterns in the review text to predict sentiment accurately.

The primary goal was to analyze customer feedback and understand satisfaction levels based on textual reviews.\n","\n","The dataset was first cleaned and preprocessed — converting text to lowercase, removing special characters, and tokenizing the reviews. Each review was then converted into numerical sequences and padded to a fixed length for input into the RNN model. The sentiment labels were created based on the average customer rating, where reviews with an average rating greater than 3.5 were considered positive and the rest negative.\n","\n","The RNN model consisted of an Embedding layer, a SimpleRNN layer with 64 units, and a Dense output layer with a sigmoid activation function. It was trained on the processed data for 5 epochs using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function.\n","\n","After training, the model achieved the following performance metrics:\n","\n","Training Accuracy: ~72%\n","\n","Validation Accuracy: ~71.5%\n","\n","Test Accuracy: 72%\n","\n","These results indicate that the model learned meaningful patterns from the review text and could effectively predict customer sentiment with reasonable accuracy.\n","\n","A custom prediction function was also implemented to test new reviews. For example:\n","\n","Input Review: “The food was great.”\n","Predicted Sentiment: Positive (Probability: 0.71)\n","\n","This demonstrates that the model successfully identifies the sentiment of unseen reviews based on learned textual patterns.\n","\n","Overall, the project highlights the effectiveness of Recurrent Neural Networks for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks like sentiment analysis.
